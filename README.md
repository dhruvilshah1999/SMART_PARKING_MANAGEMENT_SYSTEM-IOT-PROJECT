# SMART_PARKING_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM-IOT-PROJECT
VERSION-1: USING ARDUINO &amp; VERSION-2: USINF NODEMCU-ESP8266, WIFI and GOOGLE FIREBASE.
VERSION-1 was developed using ARDUINO but due to cost effectiveness and wifi connection limitation in arduino we redesign the whole project with NODEMCU-ESP8266 which is very cheap as compare to the arduino and also have inbuilt WIFI connection due to which we had use the google firebase for contineous tracking using nodemcu-esp8266 wifi module.
Project have both versions detailed information with circuit and coding in step-by-step format with videos.
